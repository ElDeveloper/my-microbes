        This page contains the personalized microbiome results generated by the <a href="https://github.com/qiime/my-microbes/" target="_blank">My Microbes</a> system for participants in the <b>Student Microbiome Project</b> at the <b>University of Colorado at Boulder</b>, <b>Northern Arizona University</b>, and <b>North Carolina State University</b>. You should have received a personalized link to your microbiome data by email. If you're not a participant in the study, but interested in seeing the data, feel free to check out the data from our de-identified list of participants.

        In this study, we asked students to collect weekly samples from their <b>forehead</b>, <b>tongue</b>, <b>palm</b>, <b>armpit</b>, and <b>gut</b> for ten weeks. After the samples were collected, we extracted DNA from those samples (over <b>3,700</b> samples in all), and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene from the bacteria and the archaea in these samples. We then used that DNA sequence data to characterize the microbial communities living at each of the sites that were sampled, as well as the temporal variability in those microbial communities. For details on the 16S rRNA gene and why it's useful in this type of study, you can refer to <a href="http://www.microbe.net/fact-sheet-ribosomal-rna-rrna-the-details/" target="_blank">this discussion</a>. Due to technical limitations we were unable to sequence the armpit samples. We additionally were not able to sequence samples from individuals who turned in fewer than six weeks of samples.

        While producing this delivery system and the results presented has been a great deal of work, it is just the beginning. Analyses of these data are ongoing and interesting trends are beginning to emerge. We hope to publish our findings in the scientific literature within the year. As our analyses progress, we will send periodic updates and may have new results to share with you. Once again, we are grateful for your participation and hope you learned something along the way. <b><i>Thank you!</i></b>
